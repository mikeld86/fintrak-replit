# FINTRAK - Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Quick Deploy

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Fastest)
1. Run `./build-for-netlify.sh` locally
2. Drag the `dist/public` folder to Netlify's deploy interface
3. Upload the entire project as a ZIP to include functions

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push this codebase to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`

## 🏗️ Local Testing

```bash
# Build the application
./build-for-netlify.sh

# Test with Netlify CLI (optional)
npx netlify dev
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
